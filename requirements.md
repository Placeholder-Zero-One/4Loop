# Vision

The vision of our product, 4Loop, is to create a social meddia platform specifically tailored for CodeCrew alumni and current students. It aims to foster a sense of community and provide a space for individuals to share their experiences, insights, and knowledge. By connecting the CodeCrew community through blogging, we aim to empower individuals to showcase their skills, collaborate, and support each other in their coding journeys.

## Pain Point

This project solves the problem of limited avenues for CodeCrew members to share their stories and connect with each other. Existing platforms may not cater specifically to CodeCrew experiences and may lack the sense of community that is unique to CodeCrew. 4Loop provides a dedicated space for CodeCrew members to network, collaborate, and engage with each other through blog posts and discussions.

## Why Care

4Loop is a valuable product for CodeCrew members as it offers an opportunity to build a strong network, gain exposure within the community, and potentially open doors to collaboration and career opportunities. By providing a platform that is focused on their experiences and interests, 4Loop enables CodeCrew members to showcase their skills, share insights, and learn from each other, ultimately supporting their growth and success.
